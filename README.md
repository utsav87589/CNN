### Day 1 update

-created the Repo, loaded the data and ran into the errors

### Day 2 update

-fixed the errors,
-preprocessed the train data

### Day 3 update

-preprocessed the test data, make the model
-and did the predictions.

### Day 4 update

-Trying anf fix the error, while seeing inside the each layer of the model that we saved.

### Day 5 update

-Reverse engineering done, successfully find out the inner of cnn, as well as visualize, what every filter/layer, sees

### Day 6 update

-fixed the bug in the yestherday file
-optimized the program to see more images and for any layer

### Day 7 update

-optimized the code, 
-visaulize the outputs, data driven from the flatten and dense layers of the CNN model
