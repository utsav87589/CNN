# CNN
This repo contains CNN (Convolution neural network) based projects like single image classification and multi class image classification. later on, as the repo grows, more projects will be added on a later stage.

### --------------------------binary classification----------------------

### Day 1 update

-created the Repo, loaded the data and ran into the errors

### Day 2 update

-fixed the errors,
-preprocessed the train data

### Day 3 update

-preprocessed the test data, make the model
-and did the predictions.

### Day 4 update

-Trying anf fix the error, while seeing inside the each layer of the model that we saved.

### Day 5 update

-Reverse engineering done, successfully find out the inner of cnn, as well as visualize, what every filter/layer, sees

### Day 6 update

-fixed the bug in the yestherday file
-optimized the program to see more images and for any layer

### Day 7 update

-optimized the code, 
-visaulize the outputs, data driven from the flatten and dense layers of the CNN model



### --------------------Multi class classification----------------------------

# kaggle link for the dataset
-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification

### Day 1 update

-created and structured more files under tha name 'multi class classification'
-loaded, preprocessed and saved the image data

### Day 2 update

- changed the labels for the image class, to feed to the model
- made the predictions and checked the metrics

### Day 3 update

- used the transfer learning and test for the dataset
- saved the models for further reverse engineering

### Day 4 update

- checked the core architect of the 'modified_mobile_net' model
- made the feature map for the first conv2 layer, more is yet to come
